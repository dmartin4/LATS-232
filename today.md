title: Maintaining Traditions Today
layout: page
---

While today we are removed from the history of immigration that was central to my family's story in the past, we still maintain many of the traditions that are informed by our Italian-American heritage.  We still have large family gatherings where the extended Coppotelli family comes together to celebrate holidays and family events.  Additionally, we have passed down family recipes, which are often made for these gatherings, from our relatives who immigrated in the 20th century.  Although the Italian-American identity and culture is constantly changing and incorporating the current American environment in which it exists, distinctive aspects of our family's experience and Italian heritage have been maintained today, and continue to inform our experience in the modern world.
