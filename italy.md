title: Home in Italy

My family came primarily from southern Italy. The Cudas, my maternal grandmother's family, came from Morano Calabro.  The Coppotellis, my maternal grandfather's family, came from Pisa.  Their families had lived in the areas surrounding these cities as far back as I have been able to trace their lineage.  These cities were home to my great-grandparents before they emmigrated, and the local cultures here were central to their development before arriving in America.  These were the homes that my family made the difficult decision to leave behind when choosing to pursue a new life in America.  While I have not been able to trace them specificaly, several members of my family remained in Morano Calabro and Pisa when my great-grandparents emmigrated, and there are likely still Cudas and Coppotellis who live in these cities today.
