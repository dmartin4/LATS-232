This archive allows you to follow the path of Italian immigrants through their journey to America and the generations of Italian-Americans that followed them.  These documents and stories explore the experiences of my family--the Coppotellis and the Cudas--as they left Italy to make a new home in America during the early 20th century.  Their story provides a lens into the broader context of Italian-American life.  Enter the archive to learn about their journey, and the ongoing story of my family into the modern day.
