title: Growing up Italian-American
layout: page
---

While their parents immigrated to America, my grandparents, Donald Coppotelli and Marie Cuda Coppotelli, were part of the first generation in their families to come of age as Italian-Americans.  Growing up in Utica, they were part of an active Italian-American community in which they navigated the path between their Italian heritage and the American culture in which they resided alongside many other first and second generation Italian-Americans.  They met as young adults in Utica, introduced by my great uncle, Anthony Cuda, and married in 1951.  My grandfather attended Syracuse University, graduating with the class of 1949, where he studied engineering.  Through this experience of growing up Italian-American, my grandparents, along with their generation, began the ongoing process of integrating Italian and American cultures and practices, laying the groundwork for the modern day Italian-American experience.
