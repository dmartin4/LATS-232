### Abstract
A collection of documents detailing the Coppotelli and Cuda family's immigration to and experience in America, and documents that document the larger Italian-American experience in America.

### History
These documents were created by a wide range of sources, both individual and institutional.  I undertook this project in the hope of both personally learning more about my family's history and the context in which it resides and to create a personal archival perspective on Italian-American experience.

### Scope and Content
The documents here include images, videos, audio, articles, and essays documenting Italian-American and family experiences.  These items document the path of one family, and place it in a larger context of Italian-American immigration and assimilation into America.  The family documents and broader contextual items are mutually informative, creating a unique and personal perspective into immigration and life as an Italian-American.

The documents are arranged along the path of my family's history.  Beginning with *Home in Italy* (1928-1935), the archive progresses through *Deciding to Leave* (1936-1937), *Immigration to America* (1936-1938), *Settling in America* (1937-1949), *Finding Success* (1950-1999), and *Maintaining Traditions Today* (1999-2018).
