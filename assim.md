title: Settling in America
layout: page
---

After arriving in America, both the Coppotellis and Cudas moved to Utica, New York, a small city in northern New York with a large Italian-American population.  While there, the Coppotellis opened a small grocery store called Cappys which Albert and Christina operated together.  Albert, who had some experience operating a small family business in Italy, ran the store while Christina, who was entirely self-educated, handled the accounting and finances for the store while raising their children.  At the time, Italian-Americans, particularly Italian immigrants, faced significant prejudice in America and often had difficulty integrating into American culture and finding work at American companies.  Accordingly, many Italian immigrants took steps to assimilate into America and recreate aspects of their Italian communities in their new homes. My grandfather, born Dominico, changed his name to Donald at the behest of his father to avoid this prejudice.  While this change removed him from his Italian identity and birth, my grandfather's choice to Americanize his name reflects the driving force behind his family's immigration to America: opportunity.  To make the most of his potential as a young person in America, he chose to prioritize acceptance in American society over his outward ties to his Italian heritage.
